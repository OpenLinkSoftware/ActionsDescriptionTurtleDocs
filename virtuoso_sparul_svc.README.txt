To exercise the SPARUL update actions describe by service 
virtuoso_sparul_query_svc, you need to be able to insert via Virtuoso's 
/sparql endpoint.

In order to do so, you may need to grant the following permissions:

grant execute on DB.DBA.SPARUL_LOAD to "SPARQL";
grant execute on DB.DBA.SPARUL_LOAD to SPARQL_UPDATE;
grant execute on DB.DBA.SPARUL_CLEAR to "SPARQL";
grant execute on DB.DBA.SPARUL_CLEAR to SPARQL_UPDATE;
grant SPARQL_UPDATE to "SPARQL" ;

The above should suffice if targetting an http endpoint. If targetting an 
https endpoint, VAL will also need to be configured appropriately.
